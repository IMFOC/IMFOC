Mathematics is often associated with strict rules, complicated language, rigor and absolute logic – especially inside the world of science. It is perhaps the fundamental backbone of the scientific process, and there is few who doubt its importance in this setting. But, mathematics is not just a tool one can use to do engineering, calculate physical properties, do statistics on society or make models for the spread of a virus. It is also an artform. 

If you ask a mathematician they will probably say that mathematics is a very creative endevour, something people outside the field are doubtful of and find a bit weird. It is perhaps even more weird to talk about art in mathematics, or conversely, mathematics in art. Through five short talks from five mathematicians from five different diciplines, we will uncover deep and intricate connections between theese two seemingly separate worlds – mathematics and art. 


*The art of mathematics* is an event during the [Hyfer]() festival in Trondheim, organized by the Department of Mathematical Sciences at NTNU.
