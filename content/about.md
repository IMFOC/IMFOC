Mathematics is often associated with strict rules, complicated concepts, rigor, and absolute certainty. It is the backbone of all modern science, and few in society doubt the importance of mathematics in these contexts. But mathematics is not just a tool that can be used in engineering projects, to calculate physical properties, to perform statistics on populations, or create models of virus spread. It is also an art form.

If you talk to a mathematician, this person would likely say that mathematics is very creative work, something that many outside the field often find a strange claim. It perhaps feels even stranger to talk about art in mathematics, and conversely, mathematics in art. Through five lectures from five mathematicians with backgrounds from five different disciplines, we will explore precisely this: the deep and intricate connections and interactions between the two seemingly separate worlds of mathematics and art.


*The art of mathematics* is an event during the [Hyfer](https://www.hyfer.no/) festival in Trondheim, organized by the [Department of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.ntnu.edu/imf) at NTNU.
