What are the connections between quantum computers and music? This question has lately been occupying a small group of researchers and hobbyists across the world, who have together pioneered the art field of quantum music. Because, as with life and art, quantum computing and music have potential to inspire each other: for instance, by putting sound to our quantum programs, could we build intuition about how to build and manipulate them, intuition that will come in handy when designing the quantum algorithms of the future? And the other way around: could we, by composing music to be played directly on the quantum computers themselves, unlock new avenues of musical creativity?
