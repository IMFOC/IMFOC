A painting, for example, can be symmetric, but there are several ways in which it can be so. A curious person could then ask: how many different ways can a painting be symmetric? What happens when we don\u0026rsquo;t restrict ourselves to a flat painting but a three-dimensional sculpture? What about hypothetical shapes in any possible dimension?\nIt turns out that mathematicians have perfected this art, and can describe mathematically every possible way something can be symmetric. The story of this result is one of the biggest achievements in mathematical history, and culminates in one of the pinnacles of abstract mathematical achievements – the classification of finite simple groups.\nThroughout the talk we will venture through the world of symmetry, exploring their simple mathematical descriptions and their uses in the arts.\n Torgeir Aambø is a PhD student in mathematics at NTNU. His research area is topology, a field of mathematics that tries to understand mathematical shapes and abstract geometries.\n","permalink":"https://imfoc.github.io/schedule/symmetry/","summary":"Torgeir Aambø","title":"Symmetryrtemmys"},{"content":"Mathematics is often associated with strict rules, complicated language, rigor and absolute logic – especially inside the world of science. It is perhaps the fundamental backbone of the scientific process, and there is few who doubt its importance in this setting. But, mathematics is not just a tool one can use to do engineering, calculate physical properties, do statistics on society or make models for the spread of a virus. It is also an artform.\nIf you ask a mathematician they will probably say that mathematics is a very creative endevour, something people outside the field are doubtful of and find a bit weird. It is perhaps even more weird to talk about art in mathematics, or conversely, mathematics in art. Through five short talks from five mathematicians from five different diciplines, we will uncover deep and intricate connections between theese two seemingly separate worlds – mathematics and art.\nThe art of mathematics is an event during the Hyfer festival in Trondheim, organized by the Department of Mathematical Sciences at NTNU.\n","permalink":"https://imfoc.github.io/about/","summary":"Mathematics is often associated with strict rules, complicated language, rigor and absolute logic – especially inside the world of science.
