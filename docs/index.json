From a practical perspective, crochet lends itself well to the rigour of mathematics, since one can very easily construct a crochet pattern from a mathematical formula. At the same time, the flexible nature of crocheted yarn means that the piece will be soft enough to be bent and folded as necessary. Since Daina Taimiņa’s first crocheted figures, several others have used crochet as a way to display objects in mathematics, showing how math can be both beautiful, soft and approachable.\nIn this talk, we will journey through the different ways crochet has been used in mathematics, seeing examples of powerful pedagogical tools, crocheted corals, illustrations of disease spread and the impact of vaccines, and more. At the same time, the resistance to using crochet as a tool in mathematics gives us a historical look into the reality of women have faced in the field.\nAlong with the presentation, there will be actual, crocheted objects, and I will show you how crocheting a hyperbolic pseudosphere can actually be a great, easy starting project for someone who has never before crocheted.\n Emma Skarstein is a PhD student in mathematics at NTNU.

Mathematical logic offers a rigorous and elegant way to analyze Sudokus. By applying logical principles and deduction, one can prove properties of Sudoku grids which can give rise to more interesting puzzles. On the other hand, one may also apply brute force computations to analyze Sudokus. By systematically trying all possible combinations of numbers, computers can answer questions about the uniqueness of solutions or the minimum number of givens required for a valid puzzle.\nThese different approaches raise intriguing questions about the nature of proof and the role of computation in mathematics. Is there an inherent beauty in the logical elegance of mathematical proofs? Can brute force computations be considered valid proofs, or do they merely provide evidence without the same level of certainty? And is there more to a proof than simply knowing with certainty the answer to a question?\n Laertis Vaso is a post doc. in mathematics at NTNU.

A painting, for example, can be symmetric, but there are several ways in which it can be so. A curious person could then ask: how many different ways can a painting be symmetric? What happens when we don\u0026rsquo;t restrict ourselves to a flat painting but a three-dimensional sculpture? What about hypothetical shapes in any possible dimension?\nIt turns out that mathematicians have perfected this art, and can describe mathematically every possible way something can be symmetric. The story of this result is one of the biggest achievements in mathematical history, and culminates in one of the pinnacles of abstract mathematical achievements – the classification of finite simple groups.\nThroughout the talk we will venture through the world of symmetry, exploring their simple mathematical descriptions and their uses in the arts.\n Torgeir Aambø is a PhD student in mathematics at NTNU.

It is the backbone of all modern science, and few in society doubt the importance of mathematics in these contexts. But mathematics is not just a tool that can be used in engineering projects, to calculate physical properties, to perform statistics on populations, or create models of virus spread. It is also an art form.\nIf you talk to a mathematician, this person would likely say that mathematics is very creative work, something that many outside the field often find a strange claim. It perhaps feels even stranger to talk about art in mathematics, and conversely, mathematics in art. Through five lectures from five mathematicians with backgrounds from five different disciplines, we will explore precisely this: the deep and intricate connections and interactions between the two seemingly separate worlds of mathematics and art.\nThe art of mathematics is an event during the Hyfer festival in Trondheim, organized by the Department of Mathematical Sciences at NTNU.\n","permalink":"https://imfoc.github.io/about/","summary":"Mathematics is often associated with strict rules, complicated concepts, rigor, and absolute certainty.
