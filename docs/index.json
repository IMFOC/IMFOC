A painting, for example, can be symmetric, but there are several ways in which it can be so. A curious person could then ask: how many different ways can a painting be symmetric? What happens when we don\u0026rsquo;t restrict ourselves to a flat painting but a three-dimensional sculpture? What about hypothetical shapes in any possible dimension?\nIt turns out that mathematicians have perfected this art, and can describe mathematically every possible way something can be symmetric. The story of this result is one of the biggest achievements in mathematical history, and culminates in one of the pinnacles of abstract mathematical achievements – the classification of finite simple groups.\nThroughout the talk we will venture through the world of symmetry, exploring their simple mathematical descriptions and their uses in the arts.\n Torgeir Aambø is a PhD student in mathematics at NTNU. His research area is topology, a field of mathematics that tries to understand mathematical shapes and abstract geometries.\n","permalink":"https://imfoc.github.io/schedule/symmetry/","summary":"Torgeir Aambø","title":"Symmetryrtemmys"},{"content":"Mathematics is often associated with strict rules, complicated concepts, rigor, and absolute certainty. It is the backbone of all modern science, and few in society doubt the importance of mathematics in these contexts. But mathematics is not just a tool that can be used in engineering projects, to calculate physical properties, to perform statistics on populations, or create models of virus spread. It is also an art form.\nIf you talk to a mathematician, this person would likely say that mathematics is very creative work, something that many outside the field often find a strange claim. It perhaps feels even stranger to talk about art in mathematics, and conversely, mathematics in art. Through five lectures from five mathematicians with backgrounds from five different disciplines, we will explore precisely this: the deep and intricate connections and interactions between the two seemingly separate worlds of mathematics and art.\nThe art of mathematics is an event during the Hyfer festival in Trondheim, organized by the Department of Mathematical Sciences at NTNU.\n","permalink":"https://imfoc.github.io/about/","summary":"Mathematics is often associated with strict rules, complicated concepts, rigor, and absolute certainty.
